**Global Marketing & Investor Documentation**

---

## Executive Summary

**Castiel** is an AI-native business intelligence platform that transforms disconnected business data into actionable insights through a unified knowledge graph. Unlike traditional BI tools that visualize data or generic AI assistants that lack business context, Castiel is built from the ground up to understand your business relationships, history, and context.

### Castiel in One Sentence

Castiel is the only platform that combines a unified knowledge graph architecture, AI-native intelligence, and universal integration capabilities to deliver context-aware business insights that understand your organization's unique relationships and data.

### Market Position

Castiel represents the next generation of business intelligence—moving beyond static dashboards and generic AI to deliver **intelligent, context-aware insights** that understand how your business actually works. We're not just another analytics tool or AI chatbot; we're a complete platform that unifies your data, understands your relationships, and proactively surfaces what matters.

### Investment Thesis

The business intelligence market is at an inflection point. Traditional tools like Tableau and Power BI excel at visualization but fail to understand business context. CRM platforms like Salesforce manage transactions but miss the bigger picture of relationships. Generic AI assistants lack grounding in your actual business data.

**Castiel solves this by being the first platform that:**
- Unifies all business data into a single, relationship-centric knowledge graph
- Provides AI that understands your business context, not just generic responses
- Integrates seamlessly with existing tools while adding intelligence
- Surfaces insights proactively, not just on-demand

This creates a **sustainable competitive moat** through:
1. **Network Effects**: More data = better insights = more value
2. **Switching Costs**: Deep integration with business workflows
3. **Technical Moat**: Unique "Shard" architecture that competitors can't easily replicate
4. **Data Moat**: Proprietary relationship mapping and context assembly

### Key Differentiators

## The Problem We Solve

Modern businesses face five critical challenges that prevent them from making data-driven decisions:

### 1. Data Silos

**The Problem**: Critical business information is trapped across multiple systems:
- Customer data in Salesforce or HubSpot
- Project information in spreadsheets or project management tools
- Documents in Google Drive, SharePoint, or email
- Communication history in Slack, Teams, or email threads
- Financial data in accounting systems

**The Impact**: 
- Sales teams can't see the full customer picture
- Project managers miss critical context from other systems
- Executives make decisions with incomplete information
- Customer success teams lack visibility into account history

**Real-World Example**: A sales rep preparing for a critical deal review spends 2 hours manually gathering information from 5 different systems, only to discover during the meeting that a key stakeholder relationship was missed because it existed in a different CRM.

### 2. Context Loss

**The Problem**: Critical relationships and insights are hidden across disconnected systems:
- Who are the real decision-makers on this deal?
- What projects are related to this customer?
- What documents support this opportunity?
- What's the sentiment in recent communications?
- What similar deals have we won or lost?

**The Impact**:
- Missed opportunities due to incomplete context
- Poor decision-making based on partial information
- Wasted time rediscovering relationships
- Inability to learn from historical patterns

**Real-World Example**: A project manager starts a new engagement without knowing that the same client had a previous project that failed due to scope creep—information that existed in the system but wasn't connected.

### 3. AI Limitations

**The Problem**: Generic AI tools lack business context and grounding:
- ChatGPT doesn't know your customers, deals, or projects
- AI assistants can't access your internal data
- Responses aren't grounded in actual business facts
- No understanding of your business relationships
- Hallucinations and incorrect information

**The Impact**:
- AI-generated insights that aren't actionable
- Time wasted verifying AI responses
- Missed opportunities because AI lacks context
- Inability to trust AI for critical decisions

**Real-World Example**: An executive asks an AI assistant "What are the risks in our Q4 pipeline?" and gets generic advice about sales pipelines instead of specific risks based on their actual deals, customer history, and market conditions.

### 4. Integration Complexity

**The Problem**: Fragmented tools require constant context switching:
- Log into multiple systems to get complete picture
- Manual data entry and synchronization
- Different interfaces and workflows
- No single source of truth
- Integration projects that take months and cost thousands

**The Impact**:
- Reduced productivity from tool switching
- Data inconsistencies across systems
- High integration costs and maintenance
- Inability to get real-time unified view

**Real-World Example**: A customer success manager needs to check account health but must log into 4 different systems (CRM, support, billing, project management) to piece together the complete picture, taking 30 minutes for what should be instant.

### 5. Time to Insight

**The Problem**: Manual data assembly delays decision-making:
- Hours spent gathering data for analysis
- Days to prepare comprehensive reports
- Weeks to identify trends and patterns
- Months to implement new integrations

**The Impact**:
- Slow response to opportunities and threats
- Decisions based on stale data
- Competitive disadvantage
- Opportunity cost of delayed insights

**Real-World Example**: A sales manager needs to understand why deals are stalling but must manually analyze 50+ opportunities across multiple systems, taking 2 days to identify patterns that AI could surface in seconds.

## The Castiel Solution

Castiel solves these problems through a fundamentally different approach: **everything is connected, everything is intelligent, and everything is actionable**.

### 1. Unified Knowledge Graph

**Everything is a "Shard"**—projects, companies, contacts, documents, notes, opportunities, and more. All Shards follow the same structure, enabling infinite relationships and connections. This isn't just a database; it's a living map of your business.

**How It Works**:
- Every piece of data (a "Shard") can relate to any other Shard
- Relationships are automatically discovered and maintained
- The entire business becomes a searchable, queryable graph
- New data automatically connects to existing relationships

**Example**: When you create a new project, Castiel automatically:
- Links it to the related company and contacts
- Associates existing documents and notes
- Connects it to related opportunities
- Surfaces similar historical projects
- Identifies relevant stakeholders

### 2. AI-Native Architecture

Castiel is **built for AI from the ground up**, not retrofitted. Every design decision considers how AI will use the data, enabling capabilities that are impossible with traditional architectures.

**Key Advantages**:
- **Context Assembly**: AI automatically gathers relevant context from across your business
- **Relationship Understanding**: AI knows how entities relate to each other
- **Proactive Intelligence**: AI surfaces insights before you ask
- **Grounded Responses**: Every AI claim is backed by source data with citations

**Example**: When you ask "What are the risks in Project Alpha?", Castiel's AI:
- Automatically gathers context from the project, related companies, contacts, documents, notes, and similar historical projects
- Analyzes the data with full business context
- Provides insights with citations to source data
- Surfaces related risks you might not have considered

### 3. Context-Aware Intelligence

Castiel's AI understands your business relationships and history, not just generic patterns. It knows:
- Who the key stakeholders are
- What similar situations occurred in the past
- What documents and communications are relevant
- What the business context means for this specific situation

**Example**: Instead of generic advice like "Follow up with the customer," Castiel might say: "Based on Project Alpha's history with Acme Corp, John Smith (VP Engineering) typically makes decisions after technical validation. The proposal document from last week hasn't been reviewed yet. Recommend scheduling a technical deep-dive with the engineering team, similar to what worked in the Q3 Enterprise deal."

### 4. Universal Integration

**Connect once, sync everywhere** with bidirectional data flow. Castiel integrates with:
- **CRMs**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho
- **Communication**: Gmail, Outlook, Slack, Teams
- **Storage**: Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Box
- **Data Sources**: Google News, RSS feeds, custom APIs
- **Custom**: Webhooks, REST APIs, GraphQL

**How It Works**:
- Flexible conversion schemas map external data to Castiel's unified model
- Bidirectional sync keeps data consistent across systems
- Real-time and scheduled synchronization
- Conflict resolution and data validation

**Example**: A Salesforce opportunity syncs to Castiel, automatically creating relationships to the company, contacts, and related documents. When the deal stage changes in Salesforce, Castiel updates the opportunity and triggers AI analysis of the change.

### 5. Real-Time Insights

Castiel's AI is **proactive, not just reactive**. It continuously monitors your business data and surfaces:
- **Risks**: Deals at risk, projects behind schedule, negative sentiment
- **Opportunities**: Upsell potential, expansion opportunities, strategic connections
- **Recommendations**: Next actions, who to engage, what to focus on
- **Predictions**: Close dates, success probability, trend forecasts

**Example**: Castiel automatically detects that a high-value opportunity hasn't had activity in 14 days and proactively generates an insight: "Enterprise Deal ($2M) has been in 'Proposal' stage for 14 days with no activity. Based on similar deals, the close probability drops 15% after 10 days of inactivity. Recommend: Schedule executive alignment meeting with John Smith (decision-maker) and share case study from similar Q3 win."
