    Authentication service for Coder IDE with multi-provider support.
    
    ## Authentication
    Most endpoints (except health checks and public auth endpoints) require JWT authentication via Bearer token:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ```
    
    ## Features
    - **Multi-Provider**: Email/password, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, SAML/SSO
    - **JWT Tokens**: Secure token generation, validation, and refresh
    - **Session Management**: Multi-device session tracking and revocation
    - **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing, password history, strength validation
    - **Account Security**: Login attempt tracking, account lockout, email verification
  version: 1.0.0
