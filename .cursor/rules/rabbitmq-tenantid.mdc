# RabbitMQ and tenantId

- Use **RabbitMQ** for all events and job triggers. No Azure Service Bus or other brokers.
- In `DomainEvent` and `createBaseEvent` use **`tenantId`** for tenant context (prefer over `organizationId`).
- Batch jobs: scheduler publishes `workflow.job.trigger`; workers consume from a queue (e.g. `bi_batch_jobs`). See ModuleImplementationGuide §9.6.
