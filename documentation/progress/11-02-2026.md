### Latest Features Added (Dataflow Plan)

**Integrations**
- Salesforce bi directional integrations: opportunities, Contacts and Accounts
- Google workspace: Google Drive, Calendar and Email

**Enrichment**
- Sentiment analysis added to data flow for email, web search (news article) and document sentiment analysis.

**Chain of Thoughts / Reasoning Engine**
- ✅ reasoning-engine: task API and sync POST `/api/v1/reasoning/reason` returning `reasoningSteps` + `conclusion`
- ✅ risk-analytics and recommendations wired to reasoning-engine for explainability
- ✅ ExplainabilityCard and RecommendationsCard render `reasoningSteps` and `conclusion`
- ✅ ai-conversation: injects reasoning as context for explain-style user messages ("why", "explain", "how come")
- ✅ GET risk-explainability returns reasoningSteps/conclusion when reasoning_engine is set

**Competitor Detection**
- ✅ Policy resolver: `getActivationFlags(tenantId, shardTypeId)` includes `competitorDetection` (from `integration_processing_settings`)
- ✅ integration-processors and data-enrichment use policy resolver for detection activation per tenant/shard type
- ✅ Risk: vector search for related shards; `detectRisksFromRelatedShards` uses enrichmentData (e.g. competitorMentions)

**Monolith → Microservices migration**
- Platform evolved from monolith to container-based microservices (api-gateway, auth, user-management, shard-manager, risk-analytics, recommendations, web-search, search-service, integration-processors, data-enrichment, reasoning-engine, etc.)
- Service-to-service communication via REST (config-driven URLs) and RabbitMQ events
- Each service: own config, Dockerfile, OpenAPI, tenant isolation

**Areas Needing Work**
- AI Data Ingestions (55%) — Architecture complete, but vendor API calls are placeholders
- Outcome & Feedback Learning Loop (60%) — Service implemented, UI needs enhancement

**Session Impact**
- Auth: cookie-based session flow end-to-end (UI → gateway → user-management)
- Logout: resilient; no hard failures from revoke/log/event
- Seed: one-shot Revimize + Super Admin bootstrap

**Critical Gaps (unchanged)**
- Azure ML Workspace deployment
- Vendor API integration in ingestion
- Test coverage and failing tests
