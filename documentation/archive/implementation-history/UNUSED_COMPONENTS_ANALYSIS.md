# Unused Components Analysis
**Generated:** January 11, 2026

## Summary

This document analyzes 4 components that are currently not imported or used in the application:
1. `Toast.tsx`
2. `StreamingDisplay.tsx`
3. `PlanEditor.tsx`
4. `ExecutionControlPanel.tsx`

---

## 1. Toast.tsx

### Current Status
- **Not imported anywhere** in the codebase
- **Replaced by:** Sonner (via `ToastContext` and `Toaster` component)
- **Location:** `src/renderer/components/Toast.tsx`

### Analysis
- The application uses `ToastContext` which wraps Sonner's `toast` function
- `Toaster` component from `@/components/ui/sonner` is used in `App.tsx`
- `Toast.tsx` is a custom implementation that's no longer needed

### Recommendation
**✅ REMOVE** - This component is redundant and should be deleted.

### Action
Delete `src/renderer/components/Toast.tsx`

---

## 2. StreamingDisplay.tsx

### Current Status
- **Not imported anywhere** in the codebase
- **Purpose:** Display streaming content from AsyncIterable
- **Location:** `src/renderer/components/StreamingDisplay.tsx`

### Analysis
- Backend has streaming support:
  - `OpenAIProvider.stream()` - streams chat completions
  - `StructuredOutputEnforcer.stream()` - streams structured outputs
  - `ModelRouter.stream()` - routes streaming requests
- Frontend doesn't use streaming:
  - `ChatPanel` shows messages after completion
  - `PlanView` shows plans after generation
- Component is well-designed and could be useful for future streaming features

### Recommendation
**⚠️ KEEP FOR FUTURE USE** - Document it for potential streaming feature implementation.

### Action
Add JSDoc comment explaining it's reserved for future streaming features.

---

## 3. PlanEditor.tsx

### Current Status
- **Not imported anywhere** in the codebase
- **Purpose:** Allow manual editing of plan steps (title, description)
- **Location:** `src/renderer/components/PlanEditor.tsx`

### Analysis
- Backend has plan modification support:
  - `PlanModificationHandler` - handles plan modifications during execution
  - Detects changes, invalidates future steps, re-validates
- Frontend doesn't allow manual editing:
  - `PlanView` is read-only
  - Plans are generated by AI, not manually edited
- Component has proper validation and could enable manual plan editing

### Recommendation
**⚠️ KEEP FOR FUTURE USE** - Could be integrated into PlanView for manual plan editing feature.

### Action
Add JSDoc comment explaining it's reserved for future manual plan editing feature.

---

## 4. ExecutionControlPanel.tsx

### Current Status
- **Not imported anywhere** in the codebase
- **Purpose:** Provide execution controls (pause, skip steps)
- **Location:** `src/renderer/components/ExecutionControlPanel.tsx`

### Analysis
- `ExecutionStatus` already has:
  - Pause/Resume functionality ✅
  - Cancel functionality ✅
  - Per-plan controls ✅
- `ExecutionControlPanel` has:
  - Per-step skip functionality ⚠️ (not in ExecutionStatus)
  - Per-phase controls (not implemented)
- Step skipping could be useful but isn't currently supported by backend

### Recommendation
**⚠️ KEEP FOR FUTURE USE** - Could be integrated if step skipping is needed.

### Action
Add JSDoc comment explaining it's reserved for future step skipping feature.

## Decision Summary

| Component | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `Toast.tsx` | **DELETE** | Replaced by Sonner, no longer needed |
| `StreamingDisplay.tsx` | **KEEP** | Useful for future streaming features |
| `PlanEditor.tsx` | **KEEP** | Useful for future manual plan editing |
| `ExecutionControlPanel.tsx` | **KEEP** | Useful for future step skipping feature |

---

## Implementation Plan

1. **Delete Toast.tsx** - Remove unused component
2. **Document remaining components** - Add JSDoc comments explaining future use
3. **Update gap analysis** - Mark components as documented/reserved
