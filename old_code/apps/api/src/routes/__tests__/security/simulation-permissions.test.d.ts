/**
 * Simulation Routes Permission Tests
 *
 * Tests for authentication and access control on simulation API routes.
 *
 * Note: Simulation routes use basic authentication only. Access control is
 * handled at the service layer based on opportunity ownership/team membership.
 *
 * Tests cover:
 * - Authentication requirements
 * - Service-level access validation (documented)
 * - Role-based access patterns
