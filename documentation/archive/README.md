# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation preserved for reference. All active documentation is in the parent `documentation/` directory.

## Archive Structure

### [Implementation History](./implementation-history/)

Contains 346+ historical implementation reports, status files, and completion summaries from the development process. These documents track the evolution of the system but are no longer actively maintained.

**Categories:**
- Implementation status reports
- Completion summaries
- Gap analysis reports
- UI enhancement reports
- Refactoring documentation
- Integration verification reports
- Testing and verification documents

**Note**: These files are preserved for historical reference. For current documentation, see the main [documentation README](../README.md).

### [Root Status Files](./root-status-files/)

Contains 42+ root-level status and completion reports that were moved from the project root during consolidation. These include:

- Implementation completion reports
- Final verification documents
- Gap analysis summaries
- Refactoring completion reports
- Migration summaries

### [Architecture (Detailed)](./Architecture-detailed.md)

A detailed architecture document with comprehensive container specifications, communication matrices, and Docker Compose structure. This is a more detailed version than the current [global Architecture](../global/Architecture.md) document.

## When to Use Archive
