- **Reasoning chain** explains the logic
- **Confidence scores** indicate prediction certainty

**Example:**
- **Competitor:** "Risk score: 0.75" (no explanation)
- **Castiel:** "Risk score: 0.75. High risk due to: (1) No activity in last 30 days, (2) Competitor mentioned in recent emails, (3) Deal size decreased 20%. Recommended action: Schedule executive meeting within 7 days."

### Competitive Advantage

| Feature | Competitors | Castiel |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Explanations** | ❌ None | ✅ Natural language |
| **Feature Importance** | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Transparent |
| **Actionability** | ⚠️ Generic | ✅ Context-specific |
