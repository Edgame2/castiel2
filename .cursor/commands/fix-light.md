Analyze the entire codebase and fix all errors:

1. Find all missing module imports and correct the paths
2. Check for undefined variables or functions
3. Fix any TypeScript/type errors
4. Resolve any webpack configuration issues
5. Check package.json for missing dependencies
6. Look for circular dependencies

Start with critical errors (cannot find module) then move to warnings.
Show me each error found and your proposed fix before applying changes.
